# WiniQuiz 🧩

This is my first project using REST architecture with Vue. I was so excited to create some SPA application and after learning a while I was able to do my simple MathQuiz webapp. This app generates math questions based on selected level and each correct answer will give you a some kinda points.
In order to play the game first you need to **log in** if you have an account or **sign up** a new one. After first login in application remembers your session till you delete cookies. You can see your results on **Home** page or check leaderboard on **Leaders** page. In order to play a game go to **Quiz** page.

Other features are on app you can download and check them.
